/**
 * This is a mixed application as seen in the public/index.html file, namely,

 *
 * The purpose of this demonstration is to show how powerful and smart react
 * really is, and why so many people use it today instead of just using some-
 * thing like `.innerHTML` or `.insertAdjacentHTML` in the DOM.

// PART 1: React

// A React component named App, used to demonstrate React's functionality
//   note that the component is being passed a prop called "view" which is
//   a positive integer (i.e. a number that is greater than or equal to 0)
function App(props) {
  const view = props.view;

  return (
    <>
    <section>
      <p>
        { view > 3 && view < 13 && <hr /> } 
        { view > 2 && <span> ðŸ‘‹ </span> } 
        <span> Hey </span>
        { view > 0 && <span> beautiful </span> }
        { view > 1 && <span> ðŸ¤¡ </span> }
        { view > 2 && <span> ðŸ‘‹ </span> }
        { view > 4 && view < 12 && <hr /> } 
      </p>
    </section>
    {
      view > 5 && (
        <section>
          <p>
            { view > 9 && view < 13 && <hr /> } 
            { view > 8 && <span> ðŸ‘‹ </span> } 
            <span> Hey </span>
            { view > 6 && <span> beautiful </span> }
            { view > 7 && <span> ðŸ¤¡ </span> }
            { view > 8 && <span> ðŸ‘‹ </span> }
            { view > 10 && view < 12 && <hr /> }

}

// The react app mounting point in the DOM, referred to as the react
// DOM root and created using `createRoot` from the ReactDOM library
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector("#root"));

// Mount the React app for the first time, using the App component with
// a "view" prop of 0
root.render(<App view={0} />);

// PART 2: DOM manipulation part

// Use DOM manipulation to add an event listener to re-mount (and hence
// refresh) the react app with a different value for the "view" prop
document.querySelector("#change_view").addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  root.render(<App view={+event.currentTarget.value} />);
});
